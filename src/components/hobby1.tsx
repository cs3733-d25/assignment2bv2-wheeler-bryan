            <p>The hobby of mine that I've decided to highlight in this website is skiing! I've always had a passion for outdoor activities, especially those in the mountains! At a young age, my parents introduced me to skiing in Lake Tahoe, and since then, I've fallen in love. From an early age, I was given the freedom to explore a vast mountain and pick my own way down, combining elements of freedom with beautiful views!</p>
